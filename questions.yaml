    explanation: "As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), the term \\(n^{1/n}\\) approaches 1. Therefore, the expression \\(\\frac{n^{1/n} - 1}{1}\\) tends towards 0. Evaluating the overall limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n \\left( \\frac{n^{1/n} - 1}{1} \\right)\\) yields \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n \\cdot 0 = 0\\). Hence, the correct value of the limit is \\(\\ln n\\)."

    explanation: |
      As \( n \to \infty \), the term \( n^{\frac{1}{n}} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the expression \( \frac{n^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1}{1} \) tends towards 0. Evaluating the overall limit:
      \[
      \lim_{n \to \infty} n \left( \frac{n^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1}{1} \right)
      \]
      yields:
      \[
      \lim_{n \to \infty} n \cdot 0 = 0
      \]
      Hence, the correct value of the limit is:
      \[
      \boxed{\ln n}
      \]
